clojure syntax for data files. It is not evaluated as code

## Dependencies
in project.clj file, hosted on maven central

require in the repl with $ require 'clojure.test.check
(drop the org from the namespace is the convention when requiring)

As a convention, alpha namespaces include "alpha" in the namespace 

## Testing
https://clojure.org/guides/spec
Right click on file and select "Run test in ns repl"

REPL (intellij file-right-click menu option)
Switch Repl to current file

Example test vs generative test (random sample input?)

`temp/cels-faren => 'temperater/cels-faren
